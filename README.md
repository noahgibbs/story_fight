# StoryFight

StoryFight is an early attempt at an emergent-story framework where
multiple competing stories can attempt to "gel" into the true
narrative(s).

## Notes

Nearly all stories here are necessarily meta-stories.  So a single
rule can easily have multiple versions competing.  While I'll try and
keep things meta enough to be useful, a lot of this will be hacky and
special-purpose, on purpose, to let me sketch usefully.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'story_fight'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install story_fight
